## Designing The Maze ##

* Using the software Autodesk Fusion 360 we have designed a marble maze that is based upon a Smith chart. Using the parameters menu one can easily reconfigure the size and dimensions of the maze to fit the almost any size board. One can easily find the software underneath Autodeskâ€™s official website and receive a one month free trial to quickly generate an STL underneath any size they wish. The STL we have included in our files is a maze designed for a 14 inch diameter round piece of wood.

## Modifying the Maze ##

* In Autodesk Fusion 360, open the parameters menu and the main parameters the user will want to modify will be:
	* body_diameter - Set the diameter of your wood
	* trough_width - Set the width of the guiding structures of the maze
	* trough_depth - Set the depth of the guiding structures
	* end_hole_depth - Set the depth of the center hole in the maze
	* distance_guide - Is approximately the distance between the center of the neighboring guiding structure and the guiding structure that the former cuts off. One should tinker with this parameter to get the correct dimensions for their maze.
