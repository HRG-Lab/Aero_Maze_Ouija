 This code is for testing that two xbees can communicate with each other. Each teensy-xbee setup will have this code. The data taken from one serial monitor will be passed from it through the TX port connected to the XBEee and through the XBee connected to the RX port
 on the recieving setup. For this to work the XBees need to be on the same frequency, i.e. 7FFF. This code was written for teensy 3.0 and teensy LC, for other setups the Serial3 will need to be changed to reflect which TX and RX ports are being used.
