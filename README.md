# Aero_Maze_Ouija #


Markup : ### Description ###
The Aero Maze Ouija is an apparatus consisting of a group of sensors coordinating a hexacopter whose main body is a marble maze.
The project is intended to be used as a teambuilding exercise. The game, as designed, is meant for six players.
Each player will be assigned a distance sensor which will be used to measure the length between the sensor and each player's hand.
This data is then sent to the drone and mapped to a PWM value to control the speed of each motor.
Each of the six motors are linked to one specific sensor, so each player will be in control of one propeller.
There will be a maze etched into the drone where there will be a marble or bb.
The goal of the game is to work as a team and navigate the marble through the maze by controlling the orientation of the drone.
